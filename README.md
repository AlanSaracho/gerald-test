**Some comments**

I think is not a good idea to have the implemented navigation, because it cause problems with the navbars.

A better option could be:


    RootStack
     └ Drawer
     |  └ Tabs
     |  |  └ Home
     |  |  └ Contacts
     |  └  Dos
     |  └  Tres
     |
     └ screen1
     └ screen2
